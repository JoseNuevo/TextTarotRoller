I am a beginner programmer.

This is a very basic C++ application that draws from an array of "cards" that I have created in either upright or reversed orientation via text representation. 

I assume no responsibility for any damage caused by use of this application.

May trigger a warning on PCs with antivirus solutions installed. 

I am working on creating a version with an installer, this should remove any sort of flagging from an antivirus system as far as I know.
