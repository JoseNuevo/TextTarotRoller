**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK I ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY USE OF THIS APPLICATION**

This is a very basic C++ application that draws from an array of my own magic "cards" that I have created in either upright or reversed orientation via text representation. 

I am contiously adding / updating cards.
